Hi! Thanks for viewing this readme file

This keymap is designed for use with the Keyman Ancient Greek Program (available for free download at: https://keyman.com/keyboards/h/greek/)

In summary, there are 4 layers to the keymap:
1) Layer 1 (called base layer in the keymap file) which is equivalent to the unshifted and shifted layers of the Keyman Classical Greek typing chart). Punctuation marks from the shifted layer are achieved by pressing and holding the relevant unshifted key (e.g. a ! can be obtained by holding down and then releasing '1').
2) Layer 2 (called FN1 layer in the keymap file) which is equivalent to the AltGr layer of the Keyman Classical Greek typing chart). Functional keys are coloured in blue and non-functiona keys are coloured orange.
3) Layer 3 (called FN2 layer in the keymap file) which is the equivalent to the AltGr + shift layer of the Keyman Classical Greek typing chart). Functional keys are coloured in blue and non-functiona keys are coloured orange.
4) Layer 4 (called FN3 layer in the keymap file) which is a settings layer containing a number of customisable functions e.g. LED profiles, bluetooth settings etc.

Switching layers is achieved by tapping the tab button twice, with the exception of the FN3 layer, which is obtained by tapping the LALT key. Once in FN3, tapping tab twice will return to the base layer.

Colours are customisable and merely require the hexadecimal values of each colour to be changed (found at the end of the keymap).

Acknowledgements:
Nothing in this project would have been possible without the invaluable support of many people, especially Bla from the AnnePro discord, who was instrumental in setting up most of the complex functions in the keymap.
